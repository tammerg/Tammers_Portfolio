    <h1><strong>Week 1</strong></h1>
    <time datetime="2015-11-1">10/30/2015</time>
    	<p>Week 1 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp has easily been one of the most exciting times of my life. Its been indescricable to meet such like minded and driven individuals, and such specialized and caring leadership. Working with, learning from, and helping my fellow classmates has been really eye opening and I look forward to the whole class growing as developers and making some really amazaing projects together. Shamoon, Jed, and Dan have been incredible and everything has just been perfect. I hope this excitement keeps up, because i don't see it fading anytime soon!!!!
