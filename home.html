		Since i was young, technology had always been my largest interest. Computers, Phones, TV's, Gaming, you name it I loved it. Although, I also had a passion for the sciences and medicine. Over time I decided to keep technology as a hobby and pursue the medical sciences as my field of study. I attended The Ohio State University, graduating in 2015 with a degree in Biology. It was then I realized I hadn't been doing what I was most passionate about. Finally, I've made the decision to go after my true dreams, and become a developer. Im excited for the road ahead, and the challenges it will bring, but look forward to becoming a well-rounded developer.
